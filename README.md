📌 **How to use it**:  
1. Copy this Markdown exactly as it is.  
2. Create or replace the `README.md` file in your GitHub repo.  
3. Commit and push.  

GitHub will then render it with clickable links, tables, and all the proper UI.  

If you want, I can also **add GitHub badges and a project preview image** so your README looks more eye-catching. That would make it look even more professional on your profile.
